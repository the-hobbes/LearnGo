To run this, you want to do the following:

- Start the server with:
  go run Server/Server.go
- Start the client, with:
  go run Client/Client.go -f Client/input.csv

Alternatively, send the server a bunch of messages with a for loop:
for i in 1 2 3 4; do go run Client/Client.go -f Client/input.csv; done
